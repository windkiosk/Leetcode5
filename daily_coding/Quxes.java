This problem was asked by Facebook.
On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: 
red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, 
they can transform into a single creature of the third color.
Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.
